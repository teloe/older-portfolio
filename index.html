  <div id="about" class="container">
    <h1 class="section-header text-center">About</h1>
    <p>My name is Tom Eloe and I’m a software developer with a background in insurance.</p>

    <p>For the last six years I worked at Allstate Insurance where I managed two branch locations at one of the largest Allstate agencies in CA. During my time there I discovered I have a passion for coding while I taught myself the basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) after work or during lunch.</p>

    <p>When I built my first website I felt inspired and knew that a career in web development was something I wanted to pursue. I recently graduated from Coding Dojo bootcamp where I accumulated over 1000 hours of intensive coding experience learning python, ruby on rails and the mean stack.</p>

    <p>My goal now is to secure a job in an environment where I can hone my skills and build a career as a software developer.</p>
